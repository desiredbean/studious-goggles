Cooper, the Golden Retriever, had never know happier days than the days he spent with his 
owner Jack. Jack and Cooper loved taking long walks and discovering the world on their small journeys. Each day was a new adventure for just the two of them. Until, Jack decided to bring Cooper a friend named Janet. Janet, the German Shepard, was so small and clumsy but Cooper was happy to have another addition to their family.
