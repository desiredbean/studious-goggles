Cooper, the Golden Retriever, had never know happier days than the days he spent with his 
owner Jack. Jack and Cooper loved taking long walks and discovering the world on their small journeys. Each day was a new adventure for just the two of them. Until, Jack decided to bring Cooper a friend named Janet. Janet, the German Shepard, was so small and clumsy but Cooper was happy to have another addition to their family.
(Nikh): Often, Jack and Cooper went on long walks in the beach. Cooper used to enjoy these walks. He loved the feeling of the sand on his paws and the smell of the fresh sea salt. This time, they decided to take Janet along as well. Cooper was very excited and looked forward to sharing this experience with his new friend Janet. 
(Hari):Janet however did not share Cooper's enthusiasm. She had never been out on the beach before and the thought of such a large body of water scared her. She would much prefer to take a nap on Jack's bed. Yet she reluctantly allowed Jack to put on her collar and lead her and Cooper towards the beach. 
(Trask): Janet paused when she first caught a glimpse of the ocean. Would it wash her away? What if she couldn't swim? Cooper gave her a gentle nudge and they continued foward. The softness of the sand was nice and relaxed her a little. Before she knew it, they had been walking on the beach for a couple of minutes.
(Chris): Cooper couldn't be happier, everything he loved about spending time with Jack could now become something they all loved doing. They walked as the waves calmly rolled over the sand. Janet felt brave and approached the water with Cooper behind her, she put her paw in and it was far to cold so they decided a walk would be more than enough. They walked back to the car and started to head home content with the day they had.
